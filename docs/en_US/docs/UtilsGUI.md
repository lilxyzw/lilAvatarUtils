## Property

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|Clean up Materials|Delete any unnecessary properties that are not used by the assigned shader. It is recommended to delete any unnecessary texture allocations, as they may result in unnecessary textures being included in the avatar, making it larger in size.|
|Clean up AnimatorControllers|Delete unnecessary sub-assets that are not referenced anywhere and are generated by editing the AnimatorController.|
|Remove Missing Components|Remove any missing components where a required script has not been imported or has been corrupted in some way.|
